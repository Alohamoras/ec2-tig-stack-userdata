# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Convert the existing TIG stack (Telegraf/InfluxDB/Grafana) Docker Compose setup into an EC2 user data script that automatically installs and configures the monitoring stack when an EC2 instance launches. This will provide immediate system and Docker monitoring capabilities without manual setup, maintaining simplicity and requiring minimal code changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to launch an EC2 instance with monitoring automatically configured, so that I can immediately see system metrics without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an EC2 instance launches with the user data script THEN the system SHALL automatically install Docker and Docker Compose
2. WHEN the Docker installation completes THEN the system SHALL deploy the TIG stack containers automatically
3. WHEN the TIG stack is deployed THEN Grafana SHALL be accessible on the configured port within 5 minutes of instance launch
4. WHEN the monitoring stack is running THEN system metrics SHALL be collected and displayed in pre-configured dashboards

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the monitoring setup to be self-contained and portable, so that I can use the same script across different EC2 instances and environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user data script runs THEN it SHALL create all necessary configuration files locally on the instance
2. WHEN the script executes THEN it SHALL NOT require external file downloads beyond the base Docker images
3. WHEN the monitoring stack starts THEN it SHALL use the existing dashboard configurations without modification
4. WHEN the instance reboots THEN the monitoring containers SHALL restart automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize monitoring configuration through environment variables, so that I can adapt the setup for different environments without modifying the core script.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN launching an EC2 instance THEN the user SHALL be able to override default ports and credentials via environment variables
2. WHEN custom environment variables are provided THEN the system SHALL use those values instead of defaults
3. WHEN no custom variables are provided THEN the system SHALL use secure default values
4. WHEN the configuration is applied THEN all services SHALL use the specified ports and credentials consistently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want the monitoring setup to follow security best practices, so that the monitoring infrastructure doesn't introduce vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user data script runs THEN it SHALL create a non-root user for Docker operations
2. WHEN containers are deployed THEN they SHALL use non-default passwords for admin accounts
3. WHEN the monitoring services start THEN they SHALL only expose necessary ports
4. WHEN persistent data is stored THEN it SHALL use appropriate file permissions and ownership

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want logging and error handling in the user data script, so that I can troubleshoot issues if the monitoring setup fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user data script executes THEN it SHALL log all major steps to a dedicated log file
2. WHEN an error occurs during setup THEN the script SHALL log the error details and continue with remaining steps where possible
3. WHEN the script completes THEN it SHALL indicate success or failure status in the logs
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the logs SHALL be accessible via standard EC2 instance logging mechanisms
